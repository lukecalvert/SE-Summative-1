## Proposal

Within my role in the Department for Education on occasion mine and other teams are required to contact large numbers of MPs. MP contact details are publicly available through the parliamentary website however there is no easy method of retrieving all the required information, and therefore going through MP profiles one at a time is very time consuming. The proposal is to develop a web scraping tool that will use the Parliamentary website API (Parliament.uk, 2025) to retrieve the required information quickly.
